THROW STATEMENT IN A CATCH BLOCK?
A throw statement can be used in a catch block to re-throw the exception that is caught by the catch statement. 
PARALLLELIZATION: 
Stream API enables developers to create the parallel streams that can take advantage of multi-core architectures and enhance the performance of Java code. I
n a parallel stream, the operations are executed in parallel and there are two ways to create a parallel stream.

Using the parallelStream() method on a collection
Using the parallel() method on a stream
Parallel Streams must be used only with stateless, non-interfering, and associative operations i.e.

A stateless operation is an operation in which the state of one element does not affect another element
A non-interfering operation is an operation in which data source is not affected
An associative operation is an operation in which the result is not affected by the order of operands
 we can use lambda expression only for functional interfaces. Or you can say interfaces which has only single abstract method(SAM).
WHY LAMBDA USED ONLY WITH FUNCTIONAL INTERFACES?
Because lambda expression came in Java 1.8 version for the purpose to support functional programming, and the cheif behavior of lambda 
expression is to accept only those interface as reference variable which have one abstract method. We call such interfaces functional interface.
